        <p>Welcome to FindersKeepers!FindersKeepers is where meaningful connections can happen. It Starts With a Swipe™. 
            Sometimes you click. Sometimes you don’t. And sometimes the talking leads to more. Opportunity is overflowing. 
            Possibilities are endless. All (adults) are welcome to come explore.
         </p>
        <p>We want FindersKeepers to be a fun, safe and inclusive space where anyone can be themselves while getting </p>
        <p>to know others. That’s what these Community Guidelines are for–to set expectations for everyone’s behavior, 
            both on and off of the app. So read on; not following these guidelines can have real consequences-from a nudge to a ban.</p>

        <!-- Bullet Points -->
        <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li class="list1">Age. You need to be at least 18 years old to join Bumble. Creating a profile that intentionally misrepresents you as being under the age of 18 is not allowed. We reserve the right to ask for your ID to verify your age, and we’ll block you from the platform if you’re underage.</li>
            <li class="list1">Profile Photos. We want your profile to celebrate your authentic self! That’s why we require at least one of your profile photos to depict only you and to clearly show your full face. We do not permit:</li>
            <li class="list1"> Profile photos that are heavily distorted or contain exaggerated or unnatural digital effects to the point where it cannot be clearly determined that you’re the person in the photos</li>
            <li class="list1">Any overlaid symbols, icons, frames, or stickers that aren’t from Bumble on your profile photos
                Memes or photos with only — or primarily — text as a profile photo</li>
            <li class="list1">Profile photos of children on their own</li>
            <li class="list1">Profile photos with unclothed children</li>
            <li class="list1">Username. Members are allowed to use initials, abbreviations, contracted or shortened versions of their name, nicknames, full names, and middle names. Members do not have to use their legal name or full name, but usernames should be an authentic representation of the name you use in everyday life. We do not permit:</li>
            <li class="list1">Any words or phrases that violate our Community Guidelines</li>
            <li class="list1">Using the name of a celebrity or fictional character</li>
            <li class="list1">Words or characters (other than a valid name) including descriptive words, symbols (e.g. $, *, @,), emojis, numbers, or punctuation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="left-text">Registration Information</h3>
        <p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Bumble accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Bumble network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your profile).

            If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that we can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes until we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the applicable retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable steps to permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems.

        <h3 class="left-text">Profile Verification Information</h3>
        <p>We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information which is open to abuse and misuse on your profile.

            When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to communicate with other Users, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on Bumble.</p>
